# OpenTrace
Inspired by TraceTogether and COVID Symptom Tracker, and written in response to COVID19.  OpenTrace is an application that can record user data and detect the presence of other BLE handsets and devices.  The goal of this application is to create a completely transparent application that can be used to save both lives and livelyhoods.
