# OpenTrace
Inspired by TraceTogether and COVID Symptom Tracker, and written in response to COVID19.  OpenTrace is an application that can record user data and detect the presence of other BLE handsets and devices.  The goal of this application is to create a completely transparent application that can be used to save both lives and livelihoods.

Currently actively working to create partnerships with people at MIT, UCSF, State of California, and inviting executives from UCSF, FedEx, Amazon, Kroger, Aldi, Target, Walmart and others to create partnerships to help build both a public use version for governments and healthcare insitiutes as well was for Companies who employ essential and other types of workers.
